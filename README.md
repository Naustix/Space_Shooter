# Space_Shooter
UPDATED for Unity 5.0.1.f1 - From the Space Shooter Tutorial for Unity 4

This only includes the scripts and project settings.
This is because those are the only parts that changed in order to work properly in Unity 5.
The rest of the assets can be downloaded off the Unity website.
I will include finished builds in this repository for play-testing.
Enjoy~
